# Derrite iOS App - Development Summary

This document outlines all the major features, improvements, and architectural decisions made during the development of the Derrite iOS safety reporting app. Use this as a reference for updating the Android version to maintain feature parity.

## 📱 App Overview

**Derrite** is a privacy-first safety reporting app that allows users to anonymously report safety issues, receive location-based alerts, and manage favorite places. All user data stays local with fuzzy location privacy protection.

---

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### **Privacy-First Design**
- **No user accounts or tracking** - completely anonymous
- **Local data storage** using iOS UserDefaults and Keychain
- **Fuzzy location coordinates** - adds random offset to protect exact locations
- **Secure storage** for sensitive report data using iOS Keychain

### **Key Managers (Singleton Pattern)**
- `PreferencesManager` - Settings, localization, user preferences
- `LocationManager` - GPS, location services, permissions
- `ReportManager` - Report creation, storage, retrieval, self-filtering
- `AlertManager` - Safety alert notifications and processing
- `FavoriteManager` - Favorite places management and monitoring
- `OnboardingManager` - First-time user guidance system

### **Security Components**
- `SecurityManager` - Data sanitization, encryption, jailbreak detection
- `SecureStorage` - Keychain integration with AES-GCM encryption
- `InputValidator` - Enterprise-grade input validation and sanitization
- `CertificatePinner` - SSL/TLS certificate pinning for MITM protection
- `CertificateHashExtractor` - Development utility for certificate hash extraction

---

## 🌟 Major Features Implemented

### **1. Bilingual Support (English/Spanish)**
**Files:** `PreferencesManager.swift`
- **Complete localization system** with 400+ translated strings
- **Dynamic language switching** without app restart
- **Contextual translations** that respect user's current language
- **Translation keys organized by feature** (alerts, settings, privacy, etc.)

**Implementation Details:**
```swift
// Centralized localization through PreferencesManager
func localizedString(_ key: String) -> String {
    let strings = currentLanguage == "es" ? spanishStrings : englishStrings
    return strings[key] ?? key
}
```

### **2. Advanced Translation System**
**Files:** `MLKitCompatibleTranslationService.swift`, `SimpleTranslationService.swift`
- **Dictionary-based translation** matching Android MLKit fallback approach
- **Smart language detection** using iOS NaturalLanguage framework
- **Word-by-word translation** with regex pattern matching
- **Translation caching** for performance
- **Bilingual error handling** with graceful fallbacks

**Key Features:**
- Translates user-generated content (safety reports)
- Manual translate button in report details
- Auto-translation when language differs from app language
- Maintains Android app compatibility

### **3. Self-Alert Prevention System**
**Files:** `ReportManager.swift`, `AlertManager.swift`, `FavoriteManager.swift`
- **Three-layer filtering** to prevent users from getting alerts for their own reports
- **ID-based tracking** for direct report matching
- **Content signature matching** to handle backend ID changes
- **Time-based filtering** (30-second window) for near-simultaneous reports
- **Works across all alert types** (location-based and favorite-based)

**Implementation Logic:**
```swift
func isUserCreatedReport(_ report: Report) -> Bool {
    // 1. Check by ID
    if userCreatedReportIds.contains(report.id) { return true }
    
    // 2. Check by content signature
    let signature = createReportSignature(report)
    if userCreatedReportSignatures.contains(signature) { return true }
    
    // 3. Time-based check (30 seconds)
    if let lastUserReportTime = userDefaults.object(forKey: "last_user_report_time") as? TimeInterval {
        let timeDiff = abs(report.timestamp - lastUserReportTime)
        if timeDiff < 30 { return true }
    }
    
    return false
}
```

### **4. Smart Alert System**
**Files:** `AlertManager.swift`, `AlertNotificationView.swift`
- **Location-based alerts** with customizable radius (0.5-5 miles)
- **Favorite location monitoring** with individual distance settings  
- **Emergency bypass mode** that overrides iOS silent mode
- **Alert deduplication** to prevent spam
- **Custom alarm sound** (safety_alarm.wav from Android app)
- **Auto-mute on interaction** (dismiss, view details, or mute button)

**Alert Prioritization:**
- Closer alerts within emergency radius override silent mode
- Visual indicators (red bell icon) for unviewed alerts
- Sound + vibration customization in settings

### **5. Address-Based Location Display**
**Files:** `GeocodingService.swift`
- **Reverse geocoding** converts GPS coordinates to readable addresses
- **Caching system** for performance optimization
- **Consistent address formatting** across all views
- **Graceful fallback** to coordinates when geocoding fails
- **Privacy-conscious** - addresses computed locally, not stored

**Used Throughout App:**
- Report details show "123 Main St, Downtown, City" instead of "37.7749, -122.4194"
- Alert notifications use real addresses
- Favorite locations display meaningful names

### **6. Subtle Onboarding System**
**Files:** `OnboardingTooltipView.swift`, `OnboardingManager.swift`
- **First-launch tooltips** that guide users through key features
- **Sequential presentation** (map → alerts → language)
- **Auto-dismiss** after 5 seconds with manual close option
- **Never shows again** after completion
- **Emergency-friendly** - doesn't block critical app usage
- **Debug reset function** for development testing

**Tooltip Sequence:**
1. "Long press the map to report a safety issue"
2. "Tap here to see safety alerts near you"  
3. "Change language here"

### **7. Dark Mode Support**
**Files:** All UI components with proper color handling
- **System-aware dark mode** that follows iOS settings
- **Custom color schemes** for safety elements (red alerts, etc.)
- **Proper contrast** for accessibility
- **Consistent theming** across all views

### **8. Enhanced Map Experience**
**Files:** `MapView.swift`, `ContentView.swift`
- **Hybrid satellite view** with business names and POI
- **Memory leak prevention** with proper MapKit cleanup
- **Metal texture crash fixes** using dismantleUIView
- **Interactive annotations** for reports and favorites
- **Visual report radius** shown as circles on map
- **Long-press gesture** for report creation

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Memory Management**
- **MapView cleanup** prevents Metal texture crashes
- **Proper UIViewRepresentable lifecycle** management
- **Cache management** for translation and geocoding services
- **Weak reference patterns** to prevent retain cycles

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Geocoding caching** reduces API calls
- **Translation caching** improves response times  
- **Efficient UserDefaults usage** for settings storage
- **Background processing** for non-critical operations

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful degradation** when services fail
- **User-friendly error messages** in both languages
- **Fallback mechanisms** for all major features
- **Debug logging** for development troubleshooting

## 🔐 Certificate Pinning Setup

**Certificate pinning has been implemented but requires configuration:**

### **Setup Steps:**
1. **Extract Certificate Hashes** (Development):
   ```swift
   #if DEBUG
   CertificateHashExtractor.extractRailwayHashes()
   #endif
   ```

2. **Update CertificatePinner.swift** with real hashes:
   ```swift
   "backend-production-cfbe.up.railway.app": [
       "sha256/[ACTUAL_HASH_1]", // Primary certificate
       "sha256/[ACTUAL_HASH_2]"  // Backup certificate  
   ]
   ```

3. **Monitor Certificate Rotation:**
   - Railway.app certificates rotate ~every 90 days
   - Set up monitoring to detect changes
   - Update both iOS and Android apps when certificates change

### **Fallback Mode:**
- Certificate pinning includes fallback to normal SSL validation
- Prevents app breakage during certificate rotation
- Logs security events for monitoring

🎯 **Ready for Android Implementation:**
All major features are fully functional and tested on iOS. The architecture and patterns are designed to be portable to Android while maintaining the same user experience and privacy protections.
